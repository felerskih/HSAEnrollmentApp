# HSAEnrollmentApp
An Enrollment Application as done for an Exercise from HSA Bank

The ClassDiagrams directory contains an initial class diagram and a class diagram of the finalized solution.

The Enrollment Application directory contains the VS project and the solution. The debug and release sub-directories are both built and contain
a sample input file.

The Source file is a collection of the source files. This is how I had my source files while developing the solution.

The TestCases directory contains .csv input files that I used to test the application. Success.csv is the current file used in the application.
To change this, simply copy and paste a .csv file to Enrollment Application\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\Data and rename it to EnrollmentData.csv.
You can also change EnrollmentData.csv manually.
